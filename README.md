# MarketingAgencyWebsite_V1

This is a landing page for a marketing agency website called Incube. It is built using the ASP.NET MVC framework and contains a header, footer, and a hero section. The hero section is a full-screen view (width 100vw and height 100vh) that is designed to grab visitors' attention and make a strong first impression.

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET MVC framework
- jQuery
- Swiper library
- Particles library

## Features

The website includes the following sections:

1. Who We Are - This section provides a brief introduction to the marketing agency and its team members.
2. Services - This section outlines the services provided by the agency and includes a call-to-action button to encourage visitors to contact the agency.
3. Contact Us - This section includes a contact form for visitors to fill out and submit.

The website  is not responsive and is only designed to display properly on screens with a width of 1300px or greater. If the screen width is less than 1300px, a big div (position fixed, width 100vw, and height 100vh) will appear, which contains a note that says "Coming Soon."

The website also includes animations, such as fade-ins, fade-outs, and left/right transitions, to provide a dynamic user experience.

## Logo

The Incube logo was generated online and is included in the header of the website.

## How to Run

To run the website, simply clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio. Then, build and run the project.

## Future Development

Future development could include adding more pages to the website, such as a portfolio page or a blog. The website could also be optimized for mobile devices and have its SEO improved.
